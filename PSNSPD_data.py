"""
The signal method has the following definition:
    Generate P-SNSPD output signal with zero or more clicks. Vector is 100 ns long using 20 ps/sample (5000 points).
    1st click (if any) is always at 30 ns, followed by zero or more clicks with an exponential distribution
    with tau = 4 ns

    Parameters:
        shifts: list of times of photon clicks. Time 0 ns is placed 30 ns into the returned signal.
        rms_noise: Vrms of white noise added to signal, default 10 mVrms
        decimate:

    Returns:
        signal: 100 ns / P-SNSPD waveform with 0 or more clicks. Signal has at least a 30 ns preamble
                with noise only.
        clicks: number of clicks contained in the signal (0-4)
        sample_time: sample-time of the returned signal


Each item contained in data_collection contains:
    1.) The number of photons detected in the collection.
    2.) The time per bin of collection
    3.) a list of length 5000 with generated data from a PSNSPD in mV.

# The first row has labels for the number of photons, the sample time per bin, and the sample number, from 1 to 5000.
# Each subsequent row will contain the items structered as in the 1.), 2.), 3.) order. 
# The first two columns will be for the number of photons and the sample time.
